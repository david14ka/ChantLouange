[SING THEM OVER AGAIN] 

1
Sing them over again to me,
Wonderful words of Life!
Let me more of their beauty see,
Wonderful words of Life!
Words of life and beauty
Teach me faith and duty.

[Chorus]
Beautiful words, wonderful Words
Wonderful words of Life! 

Beautiful words, wonderful Words
Wonderful words of Life! 

2
Christ, the Blessed One, gives to all
Wonderful words of Life!
Sinner! List to the loving call,
Wonderful words of Life!
All so freely given,
Wooing us to heaven.

3
Sweetly echo the Gospel call
Wonderful words of Life!
Offer pardon and peace to all;
Wonderful words of Life!
Jesus, only Saviour,
Sanctify forever.

4
Words that come from the heart of God,
Wonderful words of Life!
Words that speak of the cleansing blood,
Wonderful words of Life!
Words of Life and glory,
Tell the wondrous story.
