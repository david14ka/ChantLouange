[SWING LOW, SWEET CHARIOT] 

1
I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home;

A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home;

Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

2
By Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid,
No other foundation is laid
For peace, the gift of God's love.

3
If you get there before I do, 
Coming for to carry me home;

Tell all my friends Iâ€™m a-coming too,
Coming for to carry me home.
