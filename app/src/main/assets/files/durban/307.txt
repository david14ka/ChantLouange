[ONLY A SINNER] 

1
Naught have I gotten but what I received
Grace has bestowed it since I have believed,
Boasting excluded, pride I abase,
I’m only a sinner, saved by grace.

[Chorus]
Only a sinner, saved by grace!
Only a sinner, saved by grace!

This is my story- to God be the glory
I’m only a sinner, saved by grace! (X2)

2
Once I was foolish and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy I came,
I now am a sinner, saved by grace.

3
Tears unavailing no merit had I ,
Mercy had saved me, or else I must die,
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face,
But now I’m a sinner, saved by grace.

4
Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
Loving his Saviour to tell what he knows,
Once more to tell it, would I embrace,
I’m only a sinner, saved by grace!
