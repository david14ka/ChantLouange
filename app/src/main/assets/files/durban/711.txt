[SWEET PEACE] 

1
There comes to my heart one sweet strain,
A glad and a joyous refrain,
I sing it again and again,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

[Chorus]
Peace, peace, sweet peace,
Wonderful gift from above;
O wonderful, wonderful peace,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

2
By Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid,
No other foundation is laid
For peace, the gift of God's love.

3
When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
My heart with this peace did abound;
In Him the rich blessing I found,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

4
In Jesus for peace I abide,
And as I keep close to His side,
There's nothing but peace doth betide,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.
