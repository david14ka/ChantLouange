[AMAZING GRACE]

[F]

1.Amazing Grace how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind but now I see.

2.‘Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that Grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

3.Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
‘Twas Grace that brought me safe thus far,
And Grace will lead me home.

4.When we’ve been there ten thousand year
Bright shining as the sun;
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise,
Than when we first begun.

5.And when this heart and flesh shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease;
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.
