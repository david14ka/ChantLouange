[I’VE A MESSAGE]

1
I’ve a message from the Lord, Halleluiah!
The message unto you I’ll give,
‘Tis recorded in His word, Halleluiah!
It is only that you “look and live!”

[Chorus]
“Look and live!” my brother, live!
Look to Jesus   now and live!
‘Tis recorded in His word, Halleluiah!
It is only that you “look and live!”

2
I’ve a message full of love, Halleluiah!
A message, O my friend, for you,
‘Tis a message from above, Halleluiah!
Jesus said it, and I know it’s true.  

3
Life is offered unto you, Halleluiah!
Eternal life your soul shall have,
If you’ll only look to Him, Halleluiah!
Look to Jesus, who alone can save!

4
I will tell you how I came, Halleluiah!
To Jesus when He made me whole,
‘Was believing on His Name, Halleluiah!
I trusted and He saved my soul!
