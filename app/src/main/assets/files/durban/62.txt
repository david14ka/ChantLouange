[THE OLD RUGGED CROSS] 

1
On a hill far away 
Stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame,

And I love that old cross 
Where the Dearest and best,
For a world of lost sinners was slain.
     
[Chorus]
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;

I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it someday for a crown.

2
Oh, that old rugged cross, 
So despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;

For the dear Lamb of God 
Left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.

3
In the old rugged cross, 
Stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see. 

For ‘ t was on that old cross 
Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

4
To the old rugged cross 
I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;

Then He’ll call me some day 
To my home far away,
Where His glory for ever I’ll share.
