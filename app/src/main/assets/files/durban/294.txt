[Blessed Be the Fountain]

1.
Blessed be the fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed
Blessed be the dear Son of God!
Only by His stripes we are healed;
Though I’ve wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow!

[Chorus]
Whiter than the snow!
Whiter than the snow!
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, 
And I shall be whiter than snow!

2.
Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o’ercame!
Grievous were the sorrow He bore
But He suffered not thus in vain;
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below!
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow!

3.
Father, I’ve wandered from Thee;
Often has my heart gone astray!
Crimson do my sins seem to me
Water cannot wash them away!
Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise I go!
Cleanse me with Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow.
