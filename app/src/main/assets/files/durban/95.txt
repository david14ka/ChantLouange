[PASS ME NOT] 

1
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art smiling, 
Do not pass me by.

[Chorus]
S a v i o u r!   S a v i o u r!
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by.

2
Let me at Thy Throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

3
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;  
Heal my wounded broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

4
Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Who have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?
