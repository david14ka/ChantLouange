[PERFECT PEACE!] 

1
Peace!  Perfect  peace! 
In this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within. 

2
Peace!  Perfect  peace! 
By thronging duties prest?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest. 

3
Peace!  Perfect  peace! 
With sorrows surging round?
On Jesus’ bosom naught but calm is found.

4
Peace!  Perfect peace! 
With loved ones far away?
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they.

5
Peace!  Perfect peace! 
Our future  all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the Throne.

6
Peace!  Perfect peace! 
Death shadowing us and ours?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers. 

7
It is enough: 
Earth’s struggles soon shall cease,
And Jesus call to heaven’s perfect peace
