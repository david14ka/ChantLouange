[MY HOPE IS BUILT] 
 
1
My hope is built on nothing less     
Than Jesus blood 
and righteousness,

I dare not trust the sweetest frame.
But wholly trust in Jesus name (x2)

[Chorus]
Christ alone , cornerstone weak 
made strong, in saviourâ€™s love
 
Through the storn, 
he is Lord ,Lord of all (X3)
A

2
When darkness seems to hide his face, 
I rest on his unchanging grace

In every high and stormy Gale 
my anchor holds within the veil.
My  anchor holds within the veil (x2)

3
Then he shall come 
with trumpets sound oh, 
May I then in him be found.

Dress in his righteousness alone faultless, 
Stand before the throne. (x2)
