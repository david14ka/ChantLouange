[THERE IS A CALL] 

1
There is a call comes ringing oâ€™er the restless wave,
Send the light! Send the light!
There are souls to rescue; there are souls to save,
Send the light! Send the light!

[Chorus]
Send the light! The blessed Gospel light!
Let it shine from shore to shore,
Send the light! And let its radiant beams 
Light the world for ever more.

2
We have heard the Macedonian call today,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a golden offering at the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!  

3
Let us pray that grace everywhere abound,
Send the light! Send the light!
And Christlike spirit everywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!

4
Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!
