[IT IS NOT GOOD]

1
It is not good for the man to be alone,
The Lord God said,
I will make him an help meet for him,
And God made Eve for Adam.
(Repeat)

[Chorus]
It is not good for the man to be alone,
The Lord God said,
I will make him an help meet for him,
And God made Eve for Adam.

2
Abraham sent Eliezer 
To seek a bride for his son Isaac,
The deep calling unto the deep
The evidence was Rebecca.
(Repeat)

3
Our bridegroom, the Lord Jesus,
Glory to Him, for His love and care!
And we believe as He promised,
He's coming soon to take His bride. 
(Repeat)
