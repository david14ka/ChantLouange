[LET US REJOICE IN JESUS]

1
Let us rejoice in Jesus ,
He gave His Life for us,
For us, He left His Glory
And took the shame  on the Cross

[Chorus]
Rejoice, rejoice in Jesus,
He gave His life for us,
Rejoice, rejoice in Jesus,
Alleluia, Hosanna. Bis
 
2
Eternal Father, Mighty God,
He humbled Himself like a slave,
Sealed my pardon with His blood,
Oh! My Saviour suffered for me.

3
Oh Death, where is now your sting ?
Christ the Lord is risen today, 
Oh Grave, where is your victory ?
Jesus paid it all on the cross.
