[STAND UP FOR JESUS] 

1
Stand up, Stand up for Jesus, 
Ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner, 
It must not suffer loss.

	From victory unto victory 
	His army He shall lead,
	Till every foe is vanquished, 
	And Christ is Lord indeed.

2
Stand up, Stand up for Jesus, 
The trumpet call obey
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
In this His glorious day.

    Ye that are men now serve Him 
    Against unnumbered foes;
    Let courage rise with danger, 
    And strength to strength oppose.    

3
Stand up, Stand up for Jesus, 
Stand in his strength alone,
The arm of flesh will fail you,
Ye dare not trust your own.

    Put on the gospel armour,
    And put it on through prayer;
    Where duty calls, or danger,
    Be never wanting there.

4
Stand up, Stand up for Jesus,
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victorâ€™s song.

    To him that overcometh
    A crown of life shall be.
    He with the King of glory
    Shall reign eternally.

5
Stand up, Stand up for Jesus, 
Ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner, 
It must not suffer loss.

    From victory unto victory 
    His army He shall lead,
    Till every foe is vanquished, 
    And Christ is Lord indeed.
