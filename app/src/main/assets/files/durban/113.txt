[MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE] 
 
1
My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Saviour divine,

Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my sin away,

O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

2
May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;

As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee,

Pure, warm, and changeless be, 
A living fire!
   
3
While life’s dark maze I tread,
And grief around me spread,
Be Thou my guide;

Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow’s tears away,

Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.
