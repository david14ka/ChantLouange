[Come  and  Dine]

1
Jesus has a table spread 
Where the saints of God are fed,
He invites His chosen people,
“Come and dine;”
With His manna He doth feed 
And supplies our every need;
O, ‘tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!

[Chorus]
“Come and dine,” The Master calleth, 
“Come and dine;”
You may feast at Jesus’ table all the time;    
He who fed the multitude, 
Turned the water into wine,
To the hungry calleth now,
“Come and dine.”


2
The disciples came to land, 
Thus obeying Christ’s command,
For the Master called to them, 
“Come and dine”
There they found their hearts’ desire,
Bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.

3
Soon the Lamb will take His bride
To be ever at His side,
All the host of heaven will assembled be;
O, ‘twill be a glorious sight, 
All the saints in spotless white;
And with Jesus they will feast eternally.
