[I WILL SING OF MY REDEEMER]

1
I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love to me;
 
On the cruel cross He suffered
From the curse to set me free.

[Chorus]
Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer
With His blood, He purchased me;
 
On the cross, He sealed my pardon, 
Paid the debt, and made me free.

2
I will tell the wondrous story
How my lost estate, to save.

In His boundless love and mercy 
He, the ransom freely gave.

3
I will praise my Dear Redeemer, 
His triumphant power I'll tell,
 
How the victory He giveth
Over sin, and death, and hell.

4
I will sing of my Redeemer, 
And His heav'nly love to me;

He from death to life has brought me 
Son of God with Him to be.
