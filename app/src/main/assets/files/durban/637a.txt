[PRAISE TO THE LORD, THE ALMIGHTY] 

1
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, 
The King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is 
Thy health and salvation!

ALL YE WHO HEAR 
Now to His temple draw near;
Praise Him in glad adoration. (X2)
 
2
Praise to the Lord!  Over all things 
He gloriously reigneth;
Shelters thee under His wings, 
Yes, so gently sustaineth!

HAST THOU NOT SEEN 
How all thou needest hath been;
Granted in what He ordaineth? (X2)

3
Praise to the Lord, who does prosper 
Thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy 
Shall ever attend thee;

PONDER ANEW 
What the Almighty can do;
Through His great love He befriend thee (X2)

4
Praise to the Lord, who when tempest 
Their warfare are waging;
Who, when the elements madly 
Around thee are raging;

COMMAND THEM CEASE, 
Turneth their fury to peace;
Whirlwinds and waters obeying! (X2)

5
Praise to the Lord, oh, let all that 
Is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now 
With praises before Him;

LET THE ‘AMEN’ 
Sound from His people again;
Gladly we worship before Him. (X2)

6
Bonga iNkosi, ituswe 
Ngalokh’ esinakho,
Udumo lwakhe luvuswe 
Ngabantu bomhlaba.

NITHI ‘AMENI’! 
Masibabaze iNkosi,
Kuse kube-naphakade. (X2)
