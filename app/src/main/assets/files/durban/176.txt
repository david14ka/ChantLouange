[THE LOVE OF GOD] 

1
The Love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

[Chorus]
Oh. Love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall for evermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

2
When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hill and mountains call,
God’s Love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race,
The saints and angels’ song.

3
Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade, 
To write the Love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky.
