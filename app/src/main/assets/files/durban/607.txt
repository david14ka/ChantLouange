[I WILL OFFER UP MY LIFE]

1
I will offer up my life, 
In spirit and truth;
Pouring out the oil of love, 
As my worship to You.

In surrender I must give, 
My ev’ry part;
Lord, receive this sacrifice, 
Of a broken heart.

[Chorus]
Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring,
To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King!

Saviour, what can be said,  what   can   be   sung,
As a praise of Your Name , 
For the things You have done!

Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part, 
Of  the  debt  of  love that is owed
BY  THIS  THANKFUL  HEART !
         ( repeat )

2
You deserve my ev’ry breath, 
For You've paid the great cost;
Giving up Your life to death, 
Even death on the cross.

You took all my shame away, 
There defeated my sins;
Opened up the gates of heav’n
And have beckoned me in.
