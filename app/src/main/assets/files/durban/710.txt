[THE MIGHTY GOD IS JESUS] 

1
The Mighty God is Jesus 
He is the Prince of peace     
Jesus, Eternal Father 
The righteous King is He

His wisdom is wonderful 
Author of creation
The fulness of the Godhead 
Is in the Lord Jesus         

[Chorus]
All is in Him 
All is in Him
The fulness of the Godhead 
Is in the Lord

All is in Him 
All is in Him 
The Mighty God is Jesus 
And All is in Him 

2
Emmanuel: God is with us
Eternal Jehovah  
The omnipresent Spirit
That fills the universe

Holy Heavenly High Priest
The Lamb for sinners slain
The Author of redemption
We bless His Holy Name

3
The Beginning and the End 
Alpha and Omega, 
The True Word dwelt in a Man     
The Friend of the redeemed

The Wisdom and Perfection 
Righteousness and Power   
Anything I desire 
I get it from His hand

4
The God that we’re waiting for
Will be such a sweet song      
Of Israel that’s back home
When Jesus Christ returns 

He will come back to set free 
Oh, the Lamb who was slain        
Fulness of Light in Jesus
Who drives darkness away
