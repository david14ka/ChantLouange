[THERE IS A COUNTRY FAR BEYOND] 

1
There’s a country
Far beyond the starry sky,
There’s a city where 
there never comes a night;
If we’re faithful 
We shall go there by and by,
‘Tis a city Where 
the lamb is the light.

[Chorus]
In that city where the Lamb is the light,
The city where there cometh no night,
I’ve a mansion over there,
And when free from toil and care,
I am going Where the Lamb is the light.

2
Here we have our days of sunshine,
but we know
That the sun that shines upon us
now so bright,
Will be changed to clouds and rain
until we go
To the city where the lamb is the light.

3
There the flowers bloom forever 
and the day 
Shall be one eternal day without a night;  
And our tears 
Shall be forever wiped away, 
In that city where the lamb is the light.

4
Here we have our disappointments
all the while,
And our fondest hope but meet 
with bitter blight,
Though by night we weep, 
the morning brings a smile         
In that city where the Lamb is the light.

5
Then let sunlight fade, 
Let twilight bring its gloom,
Not a shadow can my blissful soul affright;
For I know that 
Up in heaven there is room,
In that city where the lamb is the light.
