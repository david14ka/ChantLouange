[NOTHING BETWEEN] 

1
Nothing between my soul and my Saviour,
Naught of this world’s delusive dream;
I have renounced all sinful pleasure;
Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.
 
[Chorus]
Nothing between my soul and my Saviour,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favour;
Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.

2
Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there’s nothing between.

3
Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved, there’s nothing between.

4
Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.
