[All  the  Way]

(Tune of ‘Jesus Lead me Up’)

[A]

1
All the way my Saviour leads me,
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my Guide?

[chorus1]
Heav’nly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know, whate’er befall me,}x2
Jesus doeth all things well;

2
All the way my Saviour leads me,
Cheers each winding path I tread,
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living Bread.

[chorus2]
Though my weary steps may falter
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me,}x2
He’s a  spring of joy I see;

3
All the way my Saviour leads me,
Oh, the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father’s house above.

[chorus3]
When my spirit, clothed immortal,
Wings its flight to realms of day
This my song through endless ages:
Jesus led me all the way.
