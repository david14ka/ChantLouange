[THERE’S NOT A FRIEND] 

1
There’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus
No, not one!  No, not one!”

None else could heal our soul’s diseases,
No, not one!  No, not one!

[Chorus]
Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done,

There’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus,
No, not one!  No, not one!

2
No friend like Him is so high and holy! 
No, not one!  No, not one!

And yet no friend is so meek and lowly. 
No, not one!  No, not one!

3
There’s not an hour that He is not near us; 
No, not one!  No, not one!

No night so dark but His love can cheer us; 
No, not one!  No, not one!

4
Did ever saint find this Friend forsake him? 
No, not one! No, not one!

Or sinner finds that He would not take him? 
No, not one!  No, not one!

5
Was e’er a gift like the Saviour given? 
No, not one!  No, not one!

Will He refuse us a home in heaven? 
No, not one!  No, not one!
