[IN MOMENTS LIKE THESE]

1
In moments like these, I sing a love song,
I sing a love song unto Jesus. 
In moments like these, I sing a love song,
I sing a love song unto Him.

[Chorus]
Singing I love You, Lord
Singing I love You, Lord 
Singing I love You, Lord
I love You.

2 
In moments like these, I lift up my hand,
I lift up my hand unto Jesus. 
In moments like these, I lift up my hand,
I lift up my hand unto Him.
