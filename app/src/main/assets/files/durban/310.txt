[THERE IS A FOUNTAIN] 

1
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Emanuel’s veins,
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains.

[Chorus]
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

2
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in His day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

[Chorus]
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

3
E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

[Chorus]
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
Redeeming Love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

4
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save,
When this poor lisping, stamm’ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave...

[Chorus]
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave;
When this poor lisping, stamm’ring  tongue
Lies silent in the grave.
(repeat)
