[I’VE WANDERED FAR AWAY]

1
I’ve wandered far away from God,
Now, I’m coming home;
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod;
Lord, I’m coming home.

[Chorus]
Coming home, coming home,
Never more to roam,
Open wide Thine arms of love
Lord, I’m coming home.

2
I’ve wasted many precious years,
Now, I’m coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears
Lord, I’m coming home.  

3
My soul is sick, my heart is sore,
Now, I’m coming home;
My strength renew, my hope restore,
Lord, I’m coming home.

4
My only hope, my only plea,
Now, I’m coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me;
Lord, I’m coming home.

5
I need His cleansing blood, I know,
Now, I’m coming home;
Oh, wash me whiter than the snow;
Lord, I’m coming home.
