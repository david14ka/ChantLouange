[I WILL SING THE WONDROUS STORY]

1
I will sing the wondrous story 
Of the Christ who died for me;

How He left His home of glory,
For the cross on Calvary.


[Chorus]
Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me
Sing it with the saints in glory
Gathered by the crystal sea


2
I was lost; but Jesus found me
Found the sheep that went astray;

Raised me up and gently led me
Back into the narrow way.


3
I was bruised but Jesus healed me-
Faint was I from many falls;

Sight was gone, and fears possessed me;
But He freed me from them all.


4
Days of darkness still come o’er me;
Sorrow’s paths I often tread;

But the Saviour still is with me,
By His hand I’m safely led.

5
He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet;

Then He’ll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet.
