[LORD JESUS, TAKE US]

1
Lord Jesus, take us,
Higher to the Father;
We shall live forever,
Closer to the Lord;
We shall be rejoicing,
In the Holy City.
( repeat )

[Chorus]
O, O, O, O, O, Alleluia!
O Alleluia (X2)

Want to meet the Father?
Follow  the Lord Jesus!
With Him weâ€™ll be dwelling
In the Holy City!
( repeat )

2
In the sparkling City,
The New  Jerusalem;
The Saints will shine brighter,
Like the stars in heaven;
For the Lord is willing,
Wonderful! Wonderful!
( repeat )

3
The great day is coming,
Of amazing glory!
We shall leap like David,
Praising God and dancing
Upon the golden streets!
What a New City! 
( repeat )
