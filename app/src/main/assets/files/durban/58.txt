[THE DAY OF REDEMPTION] 

1
Nations are breaking, 
Israel’s awaking,
The signs that the prophets  foretold;
The gentile days  numbered, 
with horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

[Chorus]
The day of redemption is near,
Men’s hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up!  Your redemption is near.

2
The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem’s restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, 
Her latter rain’s falling,
“Return, O dispersed,  to your own.”

3
Heaven’s powers are shaking, 
And many are mistaking    
God’s meaning to be of the sky;
God’s church is the power 
That’s shaking this hour:
The day of the redemption is nigh.

4
False prophets are lying, 
God’s Truth they’re denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation 
Spurns God’s revelation,
We’ll walk where the apostles have trod.
