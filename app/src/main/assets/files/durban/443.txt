[LEAD ME GENTLY HOME]

1
Lead me gently home, Father,
Lead me gently home!
‘Mid life’s darkest hours, Father,
When sad trials come.

Keep my heart from wandering,
Lest my feet should roam;
Lest I fall upon the wayside,
Lead me gently home!
         
[Chorus]
Lead me gently home, Father,
Lead me gently,
Lest I fall upon the wayside,
Lead me gently home!
 
2
Lead me gently home, Father,
Lead me gently home!
None but Thou can’st guide me,
I cannot walk alone!

I will gladly follow,
Ever follow on;
By Thy loving hand, O Father,
Lead me gently home!

3 
Lead me gently home, Father,
Lead me gently home!
When life’s toils are ended,
And parting days have come,

There to rest for ever
From all earthly gloom,
Lead me, O my heavenly Father,
Lead me gently home!
