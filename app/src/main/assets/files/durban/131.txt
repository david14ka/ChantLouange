[LEANING ON LASTING ARMS]

1
What a fellowship, 
What a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;

What a blessedness, 
What a peace of mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
        
[Chorus]
Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;

Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
 
2
Oh, how sweet to walk 
In this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;

Oh, how bright the path 
Grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

3 
What have I to dread, 
What have I to fear
Leaning on the everlasting arms;

I have blessed peace 
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
