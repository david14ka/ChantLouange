[TAKE TIME TO BE HOLY] 

1
Take time to be holy,
Speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in Him always
And feed on His word;

Make friends of God’s children,
Help those who are weak,
Forgetting in nothing,
His blessing to seek.

2
Take time to be holy,
The world rushes on,
Spend much time in secret
With Jesus alone;

By looking to Jesus,
Like Him thou shalt be,
Thy friends in thy conduct,
His likeness shall see.

3
Take time to be holy,
Let Him be thy guide;
And run not before Him,
Whate’er betide;

In joy or in sorrow,
Still follow thy Lord;
And looking to Jesus,
Still trust in His Word.

4
Take time to be holy,
Be calm in thy soul;
Each thought and each temper
Beneath His control;

Thus led by His Spirit 
To fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted
For service above.
