[TAKE MY LIFE AND LET IT BE] 

1
Take  my  life,  and  let  it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments   and   my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

	Take my hands, and let them move
	At the impulse of Thy love;
	Take my feet, and let them be
	Swift and beautiful for Thee.

2
Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King ;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

	Take my silver and my gold;
	Not a mite would I withhold:
	Take my intellect, and use
	Every power as Thou choose.

3
Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine:
Take my heart-it is Thine own,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

	Take my love: my Lord, I pour
	At Thy feet its treasure store ;
	Take myself; and I will be
	Ever, only, ALL for Thee.

4
Take my house, Lord, and myself,
Bring us closer to Thyself.
Take my spirit, soul and heart
Let in them your words impart.

	Take my house, Lord, and myself,
	Bring us closer to Thyself.
	Take my spirit, soul and heart
	Let in them your words impart.
