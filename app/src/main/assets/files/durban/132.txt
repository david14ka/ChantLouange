[SUNLIGHT] 

1
I wandered in the shades of night,
till Jesus came to me;

And with the sunlight of His love
bid all my darkness flee.  

[Chorus]
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today,
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;

Since the Saviour found me, 
took away my sin;
I have had the sunlight of His love within.

2
Though clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows round me roll;

However dark the world may be,
I’ve sunlight in my soul.    

3
While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;

I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

4
I cross the wild extended fields,
I journey o’er the plains;

And in the sunlight of His love,
I reap the golden grain.

5
Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The light that came to me;

Behold the brightness of His face,
Throughout eternity.
