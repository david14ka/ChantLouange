[SOFTLY AND TENDERLY] 

1
Softly and tenderly 
Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me,

See, on the portals 
Heâ€™s waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me!

[Chorus]
Come home, come home!
Ye who are weary, come home!

Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner come home!

2
Why should we tarry 
When Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?

Why should we linger 
And heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

3
Time is now fleeting, 
The moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me!

Shadows are gathering, 
Deathbeds are coming,
Coming for you and for me!

4
Oh, for the wonderful love 
He has promised,
Promised for you and for me!

Though we have sinned, 
He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me!
