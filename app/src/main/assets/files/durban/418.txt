[‘TIS SO SWEET TO TRUST IN JESUS]

1
‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word,
Just to rest upon the promise,
Just to know, “Thus saith the Lord”

[Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus,
Henceforth I will trust Him more!

2
Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood,
Just in simple faith to plunge me
‘Neath and healing, cleaning flood.

3
Yes, ‘tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease, 
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest and joy and peace.

4
I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend,  
And I know that Thou art with me,
Will be with me to the end.
