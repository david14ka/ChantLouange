[SOME GLAD MORNING] 

1
Some glad morning,
When this life is o’er; I’ll fly away. 

To a home on God’s
Celestial shore; I’ll fly away.  

[Chorus]
I’ll fly away, oh glory; 
I’ll fly away.

To a home on
God’s celestial shore; I’ll fly away.

2
When the shadow
Of this life is gone; I’ll fly away.

Like the birds from
Prison bars are flown; I’ll fly away.
