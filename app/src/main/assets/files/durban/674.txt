[LIFT UP THE TRUMPET]

1
Lift up the trumpet, 
And loud let it ring:
Jesus is coming again!

Cheer up, ye pilgrims, 
Be joyful and sing:
Jesus is coming again!

[Chorus]
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again! Bis

2
Echo it, hilltops; 
Proclaim it, ye plains:
Jesus is coming again!

Coming in glory, 
The Lamb That was slain;
Jesus is coming again!

3
Heavings of the earth, 
Tell the vast, wondering throng:
Jesus is coming again!

Tempests and whirlwinds, 
The anthem prolong;
Jesus is coming again!

4
Nations are angry–
By this we do know
Jesus is coming again!

Knowledge increases; 
Men run to and fro;
Jesus is coming again!

[Chorus]
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again! Bis

Yeza futhi ! ‘Yeza futhi ! 
u Jes’u yeza futhi !

Oh, Il revient ! Oh, Il revient !
Jésus revient bientôt!
