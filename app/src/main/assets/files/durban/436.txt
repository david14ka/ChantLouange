[THERE SHALL BE SHOWER] 

1
There shall be showers of blessing,
This is the promise of Love,
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

[Chorus]
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need,
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

2
There shall be showers of blessing,
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

3
There shall be showers of blessing,
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,
Come, and now honour Thy word.

4
There shall be showers of blessing,
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God weâ€™re confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call.
