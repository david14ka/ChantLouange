[ARE YOU PART OF THE BRIDE ?]

1.Are you part of the Bride
Of Jesus Christ, our Lord?
Will it be a day of gladness
Or a day of distress?

When our Lord, the Bridegroom, comes,
Will your robe be pure and white?
This is the time
To be prepared for the feast!

[chorus]
Maranatha ,  Alleluia!(x3)
Jesus comes
The Wedding Feast  is ready! 

Maranatha ,  Alleluia! (x3)
Jesus comes
The Wedding Feast  is ready!

2.Therefore won’t you deny 
The world and all its pleasures?
Are you walking in the light
And prepared to welcome Him?

If you haven’t been set free,
Behold, Jesus Christ calls you: 
This is the time
To be prepared for the feast!

3.The conditions of the world reveal 
That Christ is coming soon.
When all things have been fulfilled,
Your deliverance will come from high.

In the heavy, deep darkness 
The Morning Star will shine so bright.
This is the time
To be prepared for the feast!

4.How my heart awaits that reign!
That’s free from death and destruction.
Things of old have passed away.
Oh! It is a new creation!

There, I will meet Jesus Christ,
My King , and all the Saints.
This is the time
To be prepared for the feast!
