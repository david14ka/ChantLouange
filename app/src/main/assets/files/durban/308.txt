[O HAPPY DAY] 

1
O happy day, that fixed my choice,
On Thee, my Saviour and my God!

Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

[Chorus]
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!

He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day, 

Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!

2
‘tis done, the great transaction’s done!
I am my Lord’s, and He is mine,

He drew me, and I followed on
Charmed to confess that voice divine?

3
Now rest my long divided heart,
Fixed on this blissful centre rest!

Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed.

4
High heav’n that heard the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear,

Till in life’s latest hour I bow,
And bless in death a bond so dear!
