[KHAY’ELIHLE]

1
Khay’ elihle, khaya lami,
Mangingene esangweni;
Mangiziphumuze kuwe,
Khay’ elihle, khaya lami

Beautiful home, my home. May I enter through the gate;
May I rest in you, beautiful home, my home.

2
Kade ngangizulazula,
Ngingabon’ ubuhle bakho;
Sengifuna ngokufisa
Ngikubone, khaya lami.

I was wandering, without realising your beauty. 
I wish to see you , my home.  

3
Kunenhlanhla kuwe, khaya!
Alusekho ulusizi;
I’nyembezi ziyasulwa,
Khay’ elihle, khaya lami.

There is blessing within you home, where there is no more sorrow.
Tears will be wiped away, beautiful home, my home

4
Abalambi abakithi,
Abasomi, abasweli;
Bayaluswa oyiMvana,
Sebekuwe, khaya lami.

There is no  hunger, thirst or sufferings there .
The saints cleansed by the Lamb, will be in you my home.

5
Sengiyezwa ubumnandi
Obuvela kuwe, khaya;
Ngizongena masinyane;
Khay’ elihle, khaya lami.

I can feel the joy within you, home.
Soon I will enter the beautiful home, my home.
