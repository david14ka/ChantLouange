[MORE THAN CONQUEROR] 
 
1
More than conquerors! Such is our belief,
More than conquerors, though weâ€™re persecuted;

For the victory was obtained through faith,
By the Saviour who alone redeemed us! (X2)


[Chorus]
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love-who died for me.

2 
Let us follow Christ till we reach Calvary,
Let us not loose sight of His precious death;

If we suffer with Him here on the earth,
We shall reign with Him in heaven above!

3
Let us endure pain coming from the world,
For confessing the sweet Name of the Lord;

On Him alone do I put all my hope,
And my firm hope will never be in vain!

4
Friends, let us trust in the unseen power,
That our Lord has hidden in His word;

Hold on the word, an invincible weapon,
To overcome the enemy through Him!
