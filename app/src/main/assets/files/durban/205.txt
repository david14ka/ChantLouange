[OH, SPREAD THE TIDINGS ROUND] 

1
Oh, spread the tidings round,
Wherever man is found,
Wherever human  hearts 
and human woes abound;

Let every Christian tongue,
Proclaim the joyful sound:
The comforter has come!

[Chorus]
The comforter has come,
The comforter has come,
The Holy Ghost from heav’n
The Father’s promise give’n;

Oh, spread the tidings round,
Wherever man is found-
The comforter has come!

2                       
Lo, the Great King of kings,
With healing in His wings,
To every captive soul
A full deliverance brings;

And through the vacant cells
The song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

3
O boundless love divine,
How shall this tongue of mine,
The wond’ring mortals tell
The matchless grace divine,

That I, a child of hell,
Should in His image shine,
The Comforter has come!
