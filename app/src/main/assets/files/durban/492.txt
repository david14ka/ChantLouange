[MY JESUS I LOVE THEE] 
 
1
My Jesus I love Thee, 
I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the follies 
Of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer,
My Saviour art Thou;
If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, ’tis now.

2
I love Thee because
Thou has first loved me;
And purchased my pardon
On Calvary’s tree.
I love Thee for wearing
The thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, ’tis now.

3
I’ll love Thee in life,
I will love Thee in death;
And praise Thee as long as
Thou lendest me breath.
And say when the death dew 
Lies cold on my brow;
If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, ’tis now.

4
In mansions of glory
And endless delight;
I’ll ever adore Thee
In heaven so bright;
I’ll sing with the glittering 
Crown on my brow;
If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, ’tis now.
