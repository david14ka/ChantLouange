[SING THE WONDROUS LOVE] 

1
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;

In the mansions bright and blessed,
He’ll prepare for us a place.

[Chorus]
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be;

When we all see Jesus,
We will sing and shout the victory. 

2
While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will overspread the sky,

But when travelling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

3
Let us be the true and faithful,
Trusting, serving every day;

Just one glimpse of Him in glory,
Will the toils of life repay.

6
Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we’ll behold,

Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.
