[THE WAY OF THE CROSS] 

1
I must need go home
By the way of the cross,
There's no other way but this;

I shall ne'er get sight 
Of the gates of light,
If the way of the cross I miss.
     
[Chorus]
The way of the cross leads home,
The way of the cross leads home;

It is sweet to know as I onward go,
The way of the cross leads home.

2
I must need go on 
In the blood sprinkled way,
The path that the Saviour trod;

If I ever climb 
To the heights sublime,
Where the soul is at home with God.

3
Then I bid farewell 
To the way of the world,
To walk in it never more;

For the Lord says, "Come," 
And I seek my home,
Where He waits at the open door.
