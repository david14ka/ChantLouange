[STANDING ON THE PROMISES] 

1
Standing on the promises 
Of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages 
Let His praises ring,
Glory in the highest, 
I will shout and sing,
STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD.

[Chorus]
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises 
Of God my Saviour,
Standing, standing,
I’M STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD!

2
Standing on the promises 
That cannot fail,
When the howling storms of doubt 
And fear assail,
By the living word of God 
I shall prevail,
STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD.    

3
Standing on the promises 
I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing
In the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty 
Where Christ makes free,
STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD.

4
Standing on the promises 
Of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally 
By love’s strong cord,
Overcoming daily 
With the Spirit’s sword,
STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD.

5
Standing on the promises 
I shall not fall,
Listening every moment 
To the Spirit’s call,
Resting in my Saviour 
As my all in all,
STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD.
