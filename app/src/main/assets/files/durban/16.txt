[ISN'T HE WONDERFUL?]

Isn't He wonderful, wonderful, wonderful? 
Isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful?
Eyes have seen, ears have heard,
What's recorded in God's Word;
Isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful?

Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me,
Counsellor, Prince of peace, 
Mighty God is He;
Saving me, keeping me 
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer, 
Praise His Name.
