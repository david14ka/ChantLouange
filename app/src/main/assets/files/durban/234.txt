[JESUS LEAD ME]

1
Jesus, lead me day by day,
Keep me through thy narrow way,

Help me ever more to know
You, my Father and Saviour.

2
Jesus, fill my heart with Thee,
For You are Eternal Life,

Let the truth transform me now,
Jesus, make me one with Thee.

3
By Thy grace, please make me pure,
Perfect, holy, by Your Truth,

Meek and humble as Thou art,
By your Spirit so divine.

4
For I know Thee as the Truth;
Come down from the Holy One,

Let your Spirit dwell in us;
Jesus! Jesus! We are Thine.

5
Jesus, lead me day by day;
Teach me more Your name to know;

Guide me through the narrow way;
Make me ever one with Thee.
