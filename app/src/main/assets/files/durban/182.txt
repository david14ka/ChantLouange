[SWEET JESUS] 

1
Sweet  Jesus, sweet  Jesus,
What  a  wonder  You   are!
You are greater than the morning star;  
You are fairer, much fairer
Than  the lily that grows
By  the way  side;
You are  precious
More precious  than  gold.

[Chorus]
You are the Rose of Sharon,       
The fairest of them all,
You are everything my heart desires,
You are fairer, much fairer
Than the lily that grows by the way side;
You are precious,
More precious than gold.
