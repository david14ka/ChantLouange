[OH, HOW I LOVE JESUS] 

1
There is a Name I love to hear,
I love to sing Its worth,

It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest Name on earth.

[Chorus]
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me

2
It tells me of a Saviour’s love,
Who died to set me free,

It tells me of His precious blood;
The sinner’s perfect plea.

3
It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,

And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

4
It tells of one whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,

Who in each sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below.
