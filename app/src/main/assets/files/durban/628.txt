[O LAMB OF GOD] 

1
O Lamb of God, 
Messenger of the Lord’s grace, 
I just want to hear Your voice, 
The real language of the cross: 

"For you I was betrayed, 
And despised, mistreated, 
Beaten, bruised and wounded, 
For your  i-n-i-qu-i-t-y." 

2
O Lamb of God, 
Messenger of the Lord’s grace, 
I have sinned, I come to You,  
I call on You, answer me!

"Cos of you I was crushed, 
Was rejected by all, 
And stricken for your sin."

3
O Lamb of God, 
Messenger of the Lord’s grace, 
Purify my unclean heart,
With Your precious blood, O Lord!

"For you, My side was pierced, 
My precious blood was shed; 
In that blood, all your past, 
Sinner, was wiped away." 

4
O Lamb of God, 
Messenger of the Lord’s grace, 
I trust and I believe, Lord! 
And I receive Your pardon!
 
"On every redeemed child 
Who always does My will 
I put My holiness 
And My divine beauty!"
