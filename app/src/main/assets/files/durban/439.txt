[RESCUE THE PERISHING] 

1
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave

Weep oâ€™er the erring one, lift up the fallen
Tell them of Jesus, the Mighty to

[Chorus]
Rescue the perishing 
Care for the dying

Jesus is merciful
Jesus will save

2
Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting
Waiting the penitent child to receive

Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently
He will forgive if they only believe

3
Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore

Touched by a loving hand, wakened by kindness
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more

4
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it 
Strength for Thy labour the Lord will provide

Back to the narrow way patiently win them
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died
