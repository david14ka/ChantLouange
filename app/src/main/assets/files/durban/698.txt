[All That Our Saviour]

[F]

1
All that our’ Saviour has spoken
Came from the mouth of God;
Surely it cannot be broken,
Sealed with His precious blood.

[chorus]
Heaven and earth will pass away,
Mountains be moved and shaken,
Nations may fear and wonder
THE WORD OF GOD WILL STAND.

2
As unto Abram was given
God’s covenant word of peace,
“Counting the stars of the Heaven”
So shall your faith increase.

[chorus]
Heaven and earth will pass away,
Mountains be moved and shaken,
Nations may fear and wonder
THE WORD OF GOD WILL STAND.

3
Trust! When the light warm and tender
Seems like to you withdrawn;
Wait a few hours, and in splendor
Morning again will dawn!

[chorus]
Heaven and earth will pass away,
Mountains be moved and shaken,
Nations may fear and wonder
THE WORD OF GOD WILL STAND.

4
Trust! Tho’ all others forsake you,
Yet there remains one friend;
Mercy and truth overtake you
Down to your journey’s end.

[chorus]
Heaven and earth will pass away,
Mountains be moved and shaken,
Nations may fear and wonder
THE WORD OF GOD WILL STAND.

5
Trust! Under every condition
Till you shall reach your home;
Trust, till in perfect fruition
That which is real has come. 

[chorus]
Heaven and earth will pass away,
Mountains be moved and shaken,
Nations may fear and wonder
THE WORD OF GOD WILL STAND.
