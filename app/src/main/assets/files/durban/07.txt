[THAT MAN FROM GALILEE] 

1
In a manger long ago, 
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.

John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb  forevermore,
Oh, Christ, the Crucified of Calvary.

[Chorus]
Oh, I love that Man-from-Galilee,
For He's done  so very much for me. 
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh, I love that Man-from-Galilee

2                       
The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, "0 Lord, 
Be merciful to me!“

’Was forgiven of ev’ry sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, "Come see 
This Man-from-Galilee.”

3
The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power’ s spoken 
with love upon the sea

The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man-from-Galilee.

4
Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of man
What must he do.

These words He said to Him, 
"Ye must be born again,“
By the Spirit of 
That Man-from-Galilee.

5
The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time. 

She’s forgiven of ev'ry sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
She cried,"Come see 
That Man-from-Galilee”
