[ON THE OTHER SHORE] 

[Chorus]
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It is good enough for me

1
I’ve got a Father over yonder,
I’ve got a Father over yonder,
I’ve got a Father over yonder,
On the other shore.

2
Some bright day I’ll go and see Him,
Some bright day I’ll go and see Him,
Some bright day I’ll go and see Him,
On the other shore.

3
Won’t that be a happy meeting!
Won’t that be a happy meeting!
Won’t that be a happy meeting!
On the other shore.

4
That bright day may be tomorrow,
That bright day may be tomorrow,
That bright day may be tomorrow,
On the other shore.
