[MASTER, THE TEMPEST IS RAGING]

1
Master the tempest is raging! 
The billows are tossing high! 
The sky is o’er-shadowed with blackness, 
No shelter or help is nigh:
 
“Carest thou not that we perish?” 
How canst thou lie asleep, 
When each moment so madly is threatening 
A grave in the angry deep? 

[Chorus]
The winds and the waves shall obey Thy  will! 
‘‘Peace!... Be still!... ’’
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be, 
No waters can swallow the ship where lies 
The master of ocean, and earth, and skies : 
They all shall sweetly obey  Thy  will; 
‘‘Peace! Be still! Peace! Be still ! ’’
They all shall sweetly obey  Thy  will; 
‘‘Peace ! Peace! Be still!’’

2
Master, with anguish of spirit 
I bow in my grief to –day; 
The depths of my sad heart are troubled; 
Oh; waken and save; I pray! 

Torrents of sin and of anguish 
Sweep o’er my sinking soul; 
And I perish! I perish! Dear master; 
Oh, hasten, and take control.   

3
Master, the terror is over, 
The elements sweetly rest; 
Earth’s  sun in the calm lake is mirrored, 
And heaven’s within my breast; 

Linger, o blessed redeemer, 
Leave me alone no more ; 
And with joy I shall make the blessed harbour,
And rest on the blissful shore.
