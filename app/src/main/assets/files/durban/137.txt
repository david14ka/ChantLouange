[SWEET BY AND BY] 

1
Thereâ€™s a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;

For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

[Chorus]
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;

In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

2
We shall sing on that beautiful shore,
The melodious songs of the blest,
  
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

3
To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer our tribute of praise,

For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our days.
