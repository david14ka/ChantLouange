[THERE IS POWER IN THE BLOOD] 

1
Would you be free 
From your burden of sin?
There’s power in the blood, 
Power in the blood;
Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

[Chorus]
There’s power, power, 
Wonder-working power 
In the blood of the Lamb,

There’s power, power, 
Wonder-working power 
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

2
Would you be free 
From your passion and pride?
There’s power in the blood, 
Power in the blood;
Come for a cleansing 
To Calvary’ tide,
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

3
Would you be whiter, 
Much whiter than snow?
There’s power in the blood, 
Power in the blood;
Sin’s stains are lost 
In its life-giving flow,
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

4
Would you do service 
For Jesus your King?
There’s power in the blood, 
Power in the blood;
Would you live daily 
His praises to sing?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.
