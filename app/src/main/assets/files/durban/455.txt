[CAST YOUR BURDENS]

1
Cast your burdens unto Jesus,
For He cares for you.
(repeat)

[Chorus 1]
Higher, higher,      
Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher,
Lift Jesus higher.    
(repeat)

[Chorus 2]
Lower, lower,
Lower, lower, lower, 
Lower, lower,
Stamp Satan lower.    
(repeat)

2
Cast your burdens unto Jesus,
For He cares for you.
(repeat)
