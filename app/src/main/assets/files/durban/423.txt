[MAN OF SORROWS!]

1
Man of Sorrows! What a Name!
For the Son of God, who came
Ruined  sinners  to  reclaim.
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
                
Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
Hallelujah ! What a Saviour ! (X2)


2
Bearing shame and  scoffing  rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood.
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
                
Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
Hallelujah ! What a Saviour ! (X2)

3
Guilty, vile, and helpless we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
“Full atonement!” can it be!
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
Hallelujah ! What a Saviour ! (X2)

4
Lifted up was He to die;
“ It is finished ! ” was His cry;
Now in Heav’n exalted high.
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
Hallelujah ! What a Saviour ! (X2)

5
When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew His song we’ll sing:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour !

Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
Hallelujah ! What a Saviour ! (X2)
