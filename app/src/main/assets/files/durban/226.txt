[THE CITY FOUR SQUARE] 

1
In the land of fadeless day,
Lies the city foursquare;
It shall never pass away,
And there is no night there.

[Chorus]
God shall wipe away all tears,
There‘s no death, no pain, no fears.
And they count not time by years,
For there is no night there.

2
All the gate of pearl are made,
In the city foursquare;
All the streets of gold are laid,
And there is no night there.

3
And the gates shall never close,
To the city foursquare;
There life’s with crystal river flows, 
And there is no night there.

4
There they need no sunshine bright,                              
In the city four square;
For the lamb is all the light,
And there is no night there.
