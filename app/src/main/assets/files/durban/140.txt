[BATTLE HYMN OF REPUBLIC]

1
Mine eyes have seen the glory 
Of the coming of the Lord;

He is tramping out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;

He hath loosed the fateful lightning 
Of his terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 

[Chorus]
Glory! Glory, halleluiah!
Glory! Glory, halleluiah!
Glory! Glory, halleluiah!

HIS TRUTH IS MARCHING ON. 

2    
I have seen Him in the watch fires 
Of a hundred circling camps;

They have builded him an alter 
In the evening dews and damps;

I can read His righteous sentence 
By the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on. 

3
He has sounded forth the trumpet 
That shall never sound retreat;

He is sifting out the hearts of men Before His judgement seat;

O be swift, my soul, to answer Him!  
Be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on. 
 
4 
In the beauty of the lilies 
Christ was born across the sea,

With a glory in his bosom 
That transfigures you and me;

As he died to make men holy, 
Let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on.
