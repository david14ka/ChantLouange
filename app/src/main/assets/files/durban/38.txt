[OLD-TIME POWER] 

1
They were in an upper chamber, 
They were all with one accord, 
When the Holy Ghost descended,   
As was promised by our Lord.

[Chorus]
O Lord send the power just now,
O Lord send the power just now,
O Lord send the power just now
And baptize every one.

2                       
Yes this pow’r from heaven descended 
With the sound of rushing wind,
Tongues of fire came down upon them,
As the Lord said He would send.

3
Yes, this “Old-time” power was given
To our fathers who were true;
This is promised to believers,
And we all may have it too.
