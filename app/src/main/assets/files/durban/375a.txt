[NEARER MY GOD TO THEE] 
 
1
Nearer my God to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee!
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me;

   Still all my song to be
   Nearer my God to Thee, 
   Nearer my God to Thee, 
   Nearer to Thee!       

2
Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone;

    Yet in my dream I’d be
    Nearer my God to Thee, 
    Nearer my God to Thee, 
    Nearer to Thee!     

3
There let the way appear,
Steps unto heaven;
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy given;

     Angels to beckon me,
     Nearer my God to Thee, 
     Nearer my God to Thee, 
     Nearer to Thee!       

4
Then, with my walking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’ll raise

     So by my woes to be	
     Nearer my God to Thee,  
     Nearer my God to Thee, 
     Nearer to Thee!                

5
Or if, on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon and stars forgot,
Upward I fly,

     Still all my song shall be
     Nearer my God to Thee,    
     Nearer my God to Thee, 
     Nearer to Thee!
