[IN THIS OLD SINFUL WORLD]

1
In this old sinful world,
Full of trouble,
You came seeking for me,
Seeking for me, my Lord,
And you found me,
Your Love is so great for me. 

[Chorus]
Jesus  loves  me
Yes, He loves me,
He loves me, He died for me. (X2)

2
The crown of thorns and pain,
Was on His head,
He paid the price for me,
Yes, the crown of sorrow,
Was on His head,
He loves me, He died for me.

3
Though the world persecutes ,
Beats and mocks me,
I have one thing I know,
Jesus loves me so much,
That all I need,
He loves me ,He died for me.
