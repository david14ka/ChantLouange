[JESUS, KEEP ME NEAR THE CROSS]

1
Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain,

Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calvary’s mountain.

[Chorus]
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever,

Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

2
Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me,

There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

3
Near the cross, O Lamb of God,
Brings its scenes before me;

Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadow o’er me.

4
Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,

Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.
