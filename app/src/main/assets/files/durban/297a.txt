[THE LORD’S MY SHEPHERD] 

1
The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want;
He makes me down to lie

In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

2
My soul He doth restore again,
And me to walk doth make

Within the path of righteousness,
E’en for his own name’s sake.

3
Yea, though I walk 
through death’s dark vale,
Yet will I fear none ill;

For Thou art with me and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still. 

4
My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;

My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

5
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;

And in God’s house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.
