[JESUS THE LIGHT]  

1
All ye saints of light proclaim,
Jesus the light of the world,
Life and mercy in His name,
Jesus the Light of the world.

[Chorus]
Weâ€™ll walk in the Light, Beautiful light ,
Come where the dewdrops 
Of mercy are bright;

Shine all around us 
By day and by night,
Jesus the Light of the world.

2
Hear the Saviour earnest call,
Jesus the Light of the world,
Send the Gospel truth to all,
Jesus the Light of the world.

3
Why not seek Him then today,
Jesus the Light of the world,
Go with the truth the narrow way,
Jesus the Light of the world.

4
Come, confess Him as your King,
Jesus the Light of the world,
Then the bells of Heaven will ring,
Jesus the Light of the world.
