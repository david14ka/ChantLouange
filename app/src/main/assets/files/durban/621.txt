[Be Thou exalted]

1.Be Thou exalted forever and ever,
God of eternity, the Ancient of Days!
Wondrous in wisdom, majestic in glory,
Perfect in holiness, and worthy of praise.

[Chorus 1]
Be Thou exalted forever and ever,
God of eternity, the Ancient of Days!
Wondrous in wisdom, majestic in glory,
Perfect in holiness, and worthy of praise. 

2.Be Thou exalted, O Son of the highest,
Savior of sinful men, Redeemer and King!
One with the Father, co-equal in glory,
Humbly we come to Thee our homage to bring

[Chorus 2]
Be Thou exalted by seraphs and angels,
Be Thou exalted with harp and with song.
Saints in their anthems of rapture adore Thee,
Thine be the glory forever, Amen! 

3.Be Thou exalted, O Spirit of power,
Dwelling within our hearts to keep us from sin.
God of the ages, and Lord of Salvation,
Ruler of heav'n and earth, Thy praises we sing! 

[Chorus 3]
Be Thou exalted by seraphs and angels,
Be Thou exalted with harp and with song.
Saints in their anthems of rapture adore Thee,
Thine be the glory forever, Amen
