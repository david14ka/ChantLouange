[MY LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS] 
 
1
My life is in Your hands, Oh Lord,
My God, my Saviour. 
My life is in Your hands, Oh Lord,
My God, my Saviour. 

[Chorus]
I will praise Your name, 
“Alleluia , Alleluia”
…All days of my life,…

“I will bless Your name,”
“I will trust Your name,”
“I will lift Your name,”
“I will love Your name.”

2
I know I belong to You,
You belong to me.
I know Jesus, I am yours,
And that You are mine.
