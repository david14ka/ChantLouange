[ROCK OF AGES] 

1
Rock of ages cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee

Let the water and the blood
From Thy wounded side which flowed

Be of sin the double cure,
Save me, Lord, and make me pure!

2
Not the labours of my hands,
Can fulfil Thy lawâ€™s demands,

Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,

All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save, and Thou alone!

3
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling,

Naked, come to Thee for dress,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace,

Foul, I to the fountain fly,
Wash me, Saviour, or I die!

4
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death,

When I rise to world unknown,  
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

Rock of ages cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee
