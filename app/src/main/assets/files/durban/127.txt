[WINGS OF A DOVE] 

1
Noah had drifted
On the floods many days,
He searched for land
In various ways;

Troubles he had some,
But not from above,
God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

[Chorus]
On the wings of a snow- white dove,
God sends down His pure, sweet love,
A sign from above,
On the wings of a dove.

2
Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;

Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign
On the wings of a dove.

3
Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;

Faith wasnâ€™t forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove.
