[AND CAN IT BE THAT I SHOULD GAIN]


1.And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviour’s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?

Amazing love!  How can it be	      }x2
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me

2.‘Tis mystery all!  The immortal dies:
Who can explore  His strange design?
In vain the first-born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine.

‘Tis mystery all!  Let earth adore,  }x2
Let angel minds inquire no more. 

3.He left His Father’s throne above-
So free, so infinite His grace-
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam’s helpless race.

‘Tis mercy all!  Immense and free; }x2
For, O my God, it found out me!

4.Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray-
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;

My chains fell off, my heart was free, }x2
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

5.No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,

Bold I approach the eternal throne,	   }x2
And claim the crown, through Christ, my own
