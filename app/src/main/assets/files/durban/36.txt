[BRING THEM IN]

1
Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear, 
Out in the desert dark and drear,
 
Calling the sheep who've gone astray, 
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

[Chorus]
Bring them in, bring them in, 
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
 
Bring them in, bring them in, 
Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus.

2
Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind, 
Help Him the wand' ring ones to find? 

Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold, 
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold? 

3
Out in the desert hear their cry, 
Out on the mountains wild and high;
 
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee, 
"Go find My sheep where'er they be."
