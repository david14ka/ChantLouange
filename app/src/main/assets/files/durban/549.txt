[LORD, I HEAR OF SHOWERS]

1
Lord, I hear of showers of blessing,
Thou art scattering full and free;
Showers the thirsty land refreshing;
Let some drops now fall on me;

Even me, even me,
Let some drops now fall on me.(X2)

2
Pass me not, O God, my Father,
Sinful though my heart may be;
Thou might leave me, but the rather;
Let Thy mercy light on me;

Even me, even me,
Let Thy mercy light on me. (X2)

3
Pass me not, O gracious Saviour,
Let me live and cling to Thee;
I am longing for Thy favour;
While Thou art calling, O call me;

Even me, even me,
While Thou art calling, O call me. (X2)

4
Pass me not, O Mighty Spirit!
Thou can make the blind to see;
Witnesser of Jesus' merit,
Speak the word of power to me;

Even me, even me,
Speak the word of power to me; (X2)

5
Have I been in sin long sleeping,
Long been slighting, grieving Thee?
Has the world my heart been keeping?
O forgive and rescue me;

Even me, even me,
O forgive and rescue me; (X2)

6
Love of God, so pure and changeless,
Blood of Christ, so rich and free;
Grace of God, so strong and boundless
Magnify them all in me;

Even me, even me,
Magnify them all in me; (X2)

7
Pass me not; but pardon bringing,
Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee;
While the streams of life are springing,
Blessing others, O  Lord, bless me;

Even me, even me,
Blessing others, O  Lord, bless me; (X2)
