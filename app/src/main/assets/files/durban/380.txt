[THE GREAT PHYSICIAN] 

1
The Great Physician now is near,
The sympathising Jesus,
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the Voice of Jesus.

[Chorus]
Sweetest note in seraph’s song,
Sweetest Name on mortal tongue, 
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, Blessed Jesus.

2
Your many sins are all forgiven,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus,
Go on your way in peace to heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

3
All Glory to the risen Lamb,
I now believe in Jesus,
I love the blessed Saviour’s Name,
I love the Name of Jesus.

4
His Name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus,
Oh, how my soul delights to hear,
The charming Name of Jesus.
