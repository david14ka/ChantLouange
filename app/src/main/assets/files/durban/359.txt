[SEEKING THE LOST] 

1
Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating 
Wanderers on the mountain astray;
“Come unto Me,” His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.

[Chorus]
... Going afar...upon the mountain,...
Bringing the wanderer back again,
Back again…
Into the fold...of our Redeemer,...
Jesus, the Lamb for sinners slain.

2
Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus,
Souls that are weak and 
Hearts that are sore,
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.

3
Thus would we go on missions of mercy,
Following Christ from day to day;
Cheering the faint, and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus the Way.
