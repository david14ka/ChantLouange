[IT’S A HIGHWAY]

[Chorus]
It’s a highway to heaven
None can walk up there
But the pure in heart
It’s a highway to heaven
Walking up the King’s highway

1
My way gets brighter, my load gets lighter
Walking up the King’s highway

There’s joy in knowing with Him I’m going
Walking up the King’s highway

2
Don't have to worry; don't have to hurry
Walking up the King’s highway

Christ walks beside me, angels to guide me
Walking up the King’s highway

3
If you're not walking, start while I’m talking
Walking up the King’s highway

There'll be a blessing; you'll be possessing
Walking up the King’s highway
