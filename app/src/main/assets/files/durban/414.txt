[ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS] 

1
Onward Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus, 
who is gone before,

Christ, the Royal Master, 
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle see,
His banners go.  

[Chorus]
Onward Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus, 
Who is gone before!

2
At the name of Jesus 
Satan’s host doth flee.
On, then, Christian soldiers, 
On to victory!

Hell’s foundation quiver 
At the shout of praise,
Brothers lift your voices, 
Loud your anthems raise.

3
Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God,
Brothers, we are treading,  
Where the brave saints trod.

We are not divided, 
All one body we 
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

4
Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane, 
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain,

Gates of hell can never 
‘gaisnt the Church prevail,
We have Christ’s own promise 
And that cannot fail.

5
Onward then, ye people, 
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song.

Glory, praise and honour 
Unto Christ the King!
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing.
