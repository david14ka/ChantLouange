[SHINE, JESUS SHINE] 

1
Lord, the light of your love is shining,
In the midst of the darkness, shining;
Jesus, light of the world, shine upon us’
Set us free by the truth you now bring us,
Shine on me, 
Shine on me.

[Chorus]
Shine, Jesus shine,
Fill this land with the Father’s glory;
Blaze, Spirit, blaze,
Set our hearts on fire.
Flow, river, flow,  
Flood the nations with love and mercy;
Send forth your word,
Lord, and let there be light!

2
Lord, I come to your awesome presence,
From the shadows, into your radiance;
By the blood I may enter your brightness,
Search me,try me,consume all my darkness
Shine on me,          
Shine on me.

3
As we gaze on your kindly brightness,
So our faces display your likeness,
Ever changing from glory to glory,
Mirrored here,may our lives tell your story
Shine on me,
Shine on me.
