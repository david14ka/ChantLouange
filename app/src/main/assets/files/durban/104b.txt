[PRECIOUS MEMORIES] 

1
Precious memories of the prophet,
Flood my soul from day to day,
I remember scenes so precious
That can never pass away.
 
[Chorus]
Precious memories, how they linger,
How they ever flood my soul;
In the stillness of the midnight,
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.

2
I’ve heard the Message and Its signal
That day’s end is near at hand,
But I remember that he promised 
He’d return for those who’d stand.

3
Precious memories, glorious meetings
Across this land from sea to sea
Where I heard the prophet’s Message
That brought Life and hope to me.

4
Precious memories in this storehouse
Where the food was laid away,
We’ve returned to where He stored it,
Spiritual Food against this day.
