[I will sing of my Redeemer]

I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered
From the curse to set me free.


Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer
With His blood, He purchased me;
On the cross, He sealed my pardon, 
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story
How my lost estate, to save.
In His boundless love and mercy
He, the ransom freely gave.


Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer
With His blood, He purchased me;
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will praise my Dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin, and death, and hell.

Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer
With His blood, He purchased me;
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will sing of my Redeemer, 
And His heav'nly love to me;
He from death to life has brought me
Son of God with Him to be.

Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer
With his blood, He purchased me;
On the cross, He sealed my pardon, 
Paid the debt, and made me free.
