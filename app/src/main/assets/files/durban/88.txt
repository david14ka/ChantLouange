[I  WILL  PRAISE  HIM]

1
When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit wooing
When he said, “Wilt thou be clean?”

[Chorus]
I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
Praise the lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory all ye people,
For His blood can wash away each stain.

2
Though the way seems straight and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

3
Then God’s fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory! Glory to His Name!

4
Blessed be the Name of Jesus!
I’m so glad He took me in;
He’s forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin.
