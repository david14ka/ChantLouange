[THERE ARE PEOPLE] 

1
There are people almost everywhere,
Whose hearts are all aflame,
With the fire that fell at Pentecost
Which cleansed and made them clean,
It is burning now within my heart
All glory to His name!
And I’m glad that I can say, 
I’m one of them.

[Chorus]
One of them, Halleluiah, one of them,
I am glad that I can say, I’m one of them.

One of them, Halleluiah, one of them,
I am glad that I can say, I’m one of them.

2
Though these people may not learned be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their Pentecost
Through faith in Jesus’ name,
And are telling now both far and wide,
His power is yet the same,
And I’m glad that I can say, 
I’m one of them

3
They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptised with the Holy Ghost,
And pow’r to service came,
Now what He did for them that day,
He’ll do for you the same,
And I’m glad that I can say, 
I’m one of them. 

4
Come, my brother, seek the blessing,
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy bells ringing,
And will keep the soul aflame,
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name.
And I’m glad that I can say, 
I’m one of them.
