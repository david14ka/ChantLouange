[MORE ABOUT JESUS] 
 
1
More about Jesus would I know
More of His grace to others show

More of His saving fullness see
More of His love-who died for me

[Chorus]
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love-who died for me.

2 
More about Jesus let me learn
More of His holy will discern

Spirit of God, my teacher be
Showing the things of Christ to me

3
More about Jesus; in His Word
Holding communion with my Lord

Hearing His voice in every line
Making each faithful saying mine

4
More about Jesus, on His Throne
Riches in glory all His own

More of His Kingdom’s sure increase
More of His coming-Prince of Peace
