[I WILL SING OF JESUS LOVE]

1
I Will sing of Jesus love, 
Sing of Him who first loved me; 
For He left bright worlds above,
And died on Calvary.

[Chorus]
I will sing of Jesus love 
Endless praise my heart shall give; 
He has died that I might live, 
I will sing His love to me.

2
O the depths of love divine! 
Earth or heaven can never know, 
How that sin as dark as mine, 
Can be made as white as snow.

3
Nothing good for Him I've done; 
How could He such love bestow?
Lord, I own my heart is won, 
Help me now my love to show.
