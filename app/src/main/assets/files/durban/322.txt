[LET US SING]

1
Let us sing of His Love once again
Of the Love that can never decay.
Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain
Till we praise Him again in that day.

[Chorus]
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
Whiter than snow. Bis
 
2
There is cleansing and healing for all
Who will wash in the life-giving flood,
There is life everlasting and joy
At the right hand of God through the blood

3
Even now while we taste of His love,
We are filled with delight at His Name,
But what will it be when above
We shall join in the song of the Lamb?
 
4
Then weâ€™ll march in his Name till we come
At His bidding to enter our rest,
And the Father shall welcome us home,
To our place in the realms of the blest.

5
So with banner unfurled to the breeze,
Our motto shall holiness be;
Till the crown from His hand we shall seize
And the King in His Glory we see.
