[IT’S THE LIFE BEHIND THE NAME]


It’s the life behind the Name,
That makes the demons tremble,
It’s the life behind the Name,
That makes the proud heart humble,

	It was God, who devised a plan,
	That  in all things like a man,
	He would live, so He could give to us,
	The life behind the Name.
	(repeat)
