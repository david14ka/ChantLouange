[JUST A CLOSER WALK]

1
I am weak but Thou art strong,
Jesus keep me from all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long,
As I walk let me walk close to Thee. 

[Chorus]
Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea;
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, Dear Lord, let it be.

2
Thru this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee. 

3
When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er,
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.
