[JESUS MY SAVIOUR CAME]

1
Jesus my Saviour 
To Bethlehem came
Born in a manger 
To sorrow and shame;
Oh, it was wonderful. 
Blest be His Name!
Seeking for me, for me!  

[Chorus#1]
Seeking for me, for me!
Seeking for me, for me! 
Oh, it was wonderful 
Blest be his name!
Seeking for me, for me!     

2
Jesus my Saviour, 
On Calvary’s tree,
Paid the great debt, 
And my soul He set free
Oh, it was wonderful. 
How could it be?
Dying for me, for me!

[Chorus#2]
Dying for me, for me!
Dying for me, for me!
Oh, it was wonderful
How could it be?
Dying for me, for me!

3
Jesus my Saviour, 
The same as of old, 
While I was wand’ring 
Afar from the fold,
Gently and long 
Did He plead with my soul
Calling for me, for me!

[Chorus#3]
Calling for me, for me!
Calling for me, for me!
Gently and long did 
He plead with my soul,
Calling for me, for me!

4
Jesus my Saviour 
Shall come from on high,
Sweet is the promise
As weary years fly,
Oh, I shall see Him 
Descend from the sky,
Coming for me, for me!

[Chorus#4]
Coming for me, for me!
Coming for me, for me!
Oh, I shall see Him 
Descend from the sky,
Coming for me, for me!
