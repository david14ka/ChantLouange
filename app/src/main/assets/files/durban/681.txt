[JESUS, THY NAME I LOVE]  

1
Jesus, Thy Name I love
All other names above,
Jesus, my Lord:

O Thou art all to me;
Nothing to please I see,

Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus, my Lord.

2
Thou, blessed Son of God,
Hast bought me with Thy blood,
Jesus, my Lord:

O how great is Thy love,
All  other   loves   above,

Love that I daily prove,
Jesus, my Lord.

3
When unto Thee I flee,
Thou wilt my Refuge be,
Jesus, my Lord:

What  need  I  now  to  fear,
What earthly grief or care,

Since Thou art ever near?
Jesus, my Lord.

4
Soon Thou wilt come again;
I shall be happy then,
Jesus my Lord:

Then Thine own face Iâ€™ll see,
Then I shall like Thee be,

Then ever more with Thee,
Jesus, my Lord.
