[I’VE REACHED THE LAND]

1
I’ve reached the land of corn and wine
And all its riches freely mine
Here shines undimmed one blissful day
For all my night has passed away

[Chorus]
O Beulah land, sweet Beulah land,
As on thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore
My heaven, my home, forevermore!

2
My Saviour comes and walks with me,
And sweet communions here have we,
He gently leads me by His hand,
For this is heaven’s borderland.

3
A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is born from ever-venal trees,
And flowers that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

4
The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds to heaven’s melody,
As angels with the white-robed throng,
Join in the sweet redemption song.
