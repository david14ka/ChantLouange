[REDEEMED !] 

1
Redeemed! How I love to proclaim it;
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy
His child and forever, I am. 

[Chorus]
Redeemed! Redeemed!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb!
Redeemed!  Redeemed!
His child and forever, I am. 

2
Redeemed! And so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell,
I know that the light of His presence,
With me doth continually dwell.

3
I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long,
I sing for I cannot be silent,
His love is the theme of my song.

4
I know I shall see in His beauty,
The King in whose law I delight,
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me song in the night.

5
I know there is a crown that is waiting
In yonder bright mansions for me,
And soon with the spirits made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be.
