[IT IS JOY UNSPEAKABLE]

1
I have found His grace is all complete,
He supplies me every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus’ feet,
I am free, yes, free indeed.

[Chorus]
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Oh, the half has never yet been told.

2
I have found the pleasure I once craved,
It is joy and peace within;
What a wondrous blessing, I am saved
From the awful gulf of sin.

3
I have found that hope so bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace;
Oh, the Saviour’s presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face.

4
I have found the joy no tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll;
It is like a great o’erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul.
