[BE NOT DISMAYED]

1.Be not dismayed, what’er betide,
God will take care of you;

Beneath His wings of love abide,
God will take care of you.


[Chorus]
God will take care of you,
Thr’ every day, o’er all the way;

He will take care of you,
God will take care of you.
  
2.Through days of toil when heart doth fail
God will take care of you;
When dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.

3.All you may need He will provide,
God will take care of you;
No good you ask will be denied,
God will take care of you.

4.No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;
Lean, weary one, upon His breast,
God will take care of you.
