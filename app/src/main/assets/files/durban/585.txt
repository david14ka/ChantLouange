[MY SPIRIT, SOUL AND BODY] 
 
1
My spirit ,soul and body,
‘Jesus ,I give to You,
A consecrated offering,
Yours evermore to be. 

[Chorus]
My life is on the altar;
Lord ,I am all to You;
Your Holy Spirit seal me!
Lord ,keep me Yours alone.

2
O Jesus ,mighty Saviour,
I trust in Your great Name;
I look for Your salvation,
Your promise now I claim.

3
Now ,Lord ,I yield all my heart,
From sin’s dominion free,
For warfare and for triumph,
As weapon unto You.

4
I ’m Yours ,O blessed Jesus,
Washed in Your precious blood,
Sealed by Your Holy Spirit,
A sacrifice to God.
