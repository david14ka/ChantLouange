[PETER AND JOHN WENT TO PRAY] 

1
Peter and John went to pray
They met a lame man on the way
He asked for alms and held out his palms
And this is what Peter did say:

   Silver and gold have I none
   But such as I have give I Thee
   In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
   Rise up and walk

[Chorus]
(He went) 
Walking and leaping and praising God
Walking and leaping and praising God
In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Rise up and walk
(repeat)
