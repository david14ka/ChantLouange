[LOVE FOUND A WAY]

1
Wonderful love that rescued me, 
Sunk deep in sin;
Guilty and vile as I could be—
No hope within.

When every ray of light had fled, 
O glorious day!
Raising my soul from out the dead, 
Love found a way.

[Chorus]
Love found a way, 
To redeem my soul;
Love found a way, 
That could make me whole.

Love sent my Lord 
To the cross of shame;
Love found a way, 
O praise His Holy Name!

2
Love brought my Saviour here to die 
On Calvary,
For such a sinful wretch as I, 
How can it be?

Love bridged the gulf ’tween me and Heaven, 
taught me to pray,
I’m redeemed, set free, forgiven, 
Love found a way.

3
Love opened wide the gates of light 
To heaven’s domain;
Where in eternal po’er and might, 
Jesus shall reign.

Love lifted me from depths of woe 
To endless day;
There was no help in earth below,
Love found a way.
