[SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER] 

1
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me, at my Father’s Throne,
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft, escaped the tempter’s snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

2
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
The joy I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for Thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
Where God, my Saviour, shows His face,
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer.

3
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer.
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word and trust His grace,
I’ll cast on him my every care,
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer.
