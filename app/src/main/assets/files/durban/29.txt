[JESUS LOVES ME]

1
Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;

Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.


[Chorus]
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
 
The Bible tells me so.
(repeat)      

2
Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gates to open wide;

He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

3
Jesus loves me! loves me still,
Though I'm very weak and ill;

From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie.

4
Jesus loves me! He will stay
Close beside me all the way;

He did bleed and died for me,
I will henceforth live for Him.
