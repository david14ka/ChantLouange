[SOWING IN THE MORNING] 

1
Sowing in the morning, 
Sowing seeds of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide 
And the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest, 
And the time of reaping,
We shall come rejoicing, 
Bringing in the sheaves.

[Chorus]
Bringing in the sheaves!
Bringing in the sheaves!

We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves! 
(repeat)

2 
Sowing in the sunshine, 
Sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds 
Nor winter’s chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest 
And the labour ended,
We shall come rejoicing, 
Bringing in the sheaves.

3
Go then, ever weeping, 
Sowing for the Master,
Though the loss sustained our
Spirits often grieves;  
When our weeping’s over,   
He will bid us welcome,
We shall come rejoicing, 
Bringing in the sheaves.
