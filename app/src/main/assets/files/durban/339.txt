[Be Thou my vision]

1.Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art-
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

2.Be Thou my Wisdom,  Thou my true Word;
Ever with Thee, thou my delight.
Thou my great Father, I thy true son:
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

3.Be thou my battle-shield, sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity, thou my delight.  
Thou my soul’s shelter, Thou my high tower:
Raise Thou me heavenward, O power of my power.

4.Riches I heed not, nor man‘s empty praise,
Thou mine inheritance, now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

5.High King of heaven, after victory won,
May I reach heaven’s joys,O bright heaven’s Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my  Vision, O Ruler of all.
