[BLESSED REDEEMER]

1
Blessed Redeemer, full of compassion,
Great is Thy mercy, boundless and free;
Now in my weakness, seeking Thy favour,
Lord, I am coming closer to Thee.

[Chorus]
Blessed redeemer, wonderful Saviour,
Fountain of wisdom, Ancient of days,
Hope of the faithful, light of all ages,
Jesus, my Saviour, Thee will I praise

2
Blessed Redeemer, Thou art my Refuge,
Under Thy watch-care, safe I shall be;
Gladly adoring, joyfully trusting,
Still I am coming closer to Thee.

3
Blessed redeemer, gracious and tender,
Now and forever dwell Thou in me;
Thou my Protector, Shield, and Defender,
Draw me and keep me closer to Thee.
