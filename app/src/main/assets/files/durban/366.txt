[SHALL WE GATHER AT THE RIVER] 

1
Shall we gather at the river,
Where bright angel-feet have trod,
With its crystal tide forever,
Flowing by the throne of God?

[Chorus]
Yes, we’ll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river,
That flows by the throne of God.

2
On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy golden day.

3
Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down,
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

4
At the shining of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour’s face,
Saints, whom death will never sever,
Raise their songs of saving grace.

5
Soon we’ll reach the silver river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace.
