[All Things Bright and Beautiful]


[chorus]
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,

All things wise and wonderful:
The Lord God made them all.

1
Each little flow’r that opens,
Each little bird that sings,

He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.

2
The purple-headed mountains,
The river running by,

The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky.

3
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,

The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.

4
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,

The rushes by the water,
To gather every day.

5
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell

How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.
