[MY SINS WERE HIGHER THAN THE MOUNTAIN] 
 
1
My sins were 
Higher than the mountain
When the Lord JUSTIFIED me

My sins were 
Higher than the mountain
When the Lord SANCTIFIED me

[Chorus]
S i n g i n g   g l o r y ! Hallelujah 
When the fire came down  (X3)
Singing glory, hallelujah,  when the fire … 
When the Lord JUSTIFIED me

S i n g i n g   g l o r y ! Hallelujah 
When the fire came down  (X3)
Singing glory, hallelujah,  when the fire … 
When the Lord SANCTIFIED me

2
My sins were 
Deeper than the ocean
When the Lord JUSTIFIED me

My sins were 
Deeper than the ocean
When the Lord SANCTIFIED me

3
My sins were 
Wider than the whole world
When the Lord JUSTIFIED me

My sins were 
Wider than the whole world
When the Lord SANCTIFIED me

4
My sins were 
Flowing like a river
When the Lord JUSTIFIED me

My sins were 
Flowing like a river
When the Lord SANCTIFIED me
