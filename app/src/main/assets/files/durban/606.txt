[ONCE FOR ALL] 

1
Free from the law, Oh, happy condition!
Jesus has bled and there is remission;
Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,
Christ has redeemed us once for all.

[Chorus]
Once for all, Oh, brother believe it,
Once for all, Oh, sister receive it;
Cling to the Cross, the burden will fall,
Christ has redeemed us once for all.

2
There on the Cross your burden up-bearing,
Thorns on His brow your Saviour is wearing;
Never again your sin need appal,
You have been pardoned once for all.

3
Now we are free, there’s no condemnation;
Jesus provides a  perfect salvation:
“Come unto Me”, Oh, hear His sweet call,
Come, and He saves us once for all.

4
Children of God, Oh, glorious calling,
Surely His Grace will keep us from falling;
Passing from death to life at His call,
Blessed salvation once for all.
