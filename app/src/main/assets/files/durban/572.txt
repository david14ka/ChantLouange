[JESUS CHRIST WAS WOUNDED]  

1
Jesus Christ was wounded for my transgressions
And was bruised for my iniquity.

Thus the bitter chastisement that gives me peace
Fell upon Him for my salvation.

[Chorus]
When the Lord Jesus walkâ€™ in the way of death,
It was for me;  it was for me, 

Setting me free from my dreadful conditions,
Jesus suffered for me.
(repeat)

2
It is by His painful stripes that I was healed.
Give Him all the glory and honour!

Conqueror of Calvary, the King of kings,
Give Him the everlasting glory!

3
My Lord Jesus was afflicted and oppressed,
And yet He chose to remain silent,

Like a lamb that is taken to the slaughter.
All that happened to provide me life.

4
There at the cross, Jesus finished the work;
All was accomplished at Golgotha,
 
As my Lord and Redeemer Himself said;
And I trust the work of Calvary.
