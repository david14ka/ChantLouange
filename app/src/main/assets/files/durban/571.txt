[THERE IS NO OTHER GOD LIKE YOU] 

1
There is no other God like You,
Hidden, You reveal Yourself,
God of Israel, 
You are worthy, Oh Lord!
(You are worthy!)

[Chorus]
Receive Glory, Honour and all Power,
You are worthy, Oh Lord!
(You are worthy!)
Receive Glory, Honour and all Power,
You are worthy, Oh Lord!

2
You have created everything,
You uphold them by the Word 
Of Your power, 
You are worthy, Oh Lord!
(You are worthy!)

3
Like the twenty-four elders we shall cast,
Our crowns before 
Your Throne,
You are worthy, Oh Lord!
(You are worthy!)
