[LORD, I LIFT YOUR NAME HIGH]

Lord, I lift Your Name on high!
Lord, I love to sing Your praises!
I’m so glad You made  my life,
I’m so glad You came to save us. Bis

You came from heaven to earth,
To show the way;
From the earth to the cross,
My debt to pay;
From the cross to the grave, 
From the grave to the sky,
Lord ,I lift Your Name on high! Bis
(Repeat All)
