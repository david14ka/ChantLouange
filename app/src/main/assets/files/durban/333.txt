[BIND US TOGETHER]

[Chorus]
Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together,
With cords that cannot be broken;
Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together
O bind us together in love.

1.There  is  only one God,
There  is  only one King,
There  is only one Body;
That   is   why  we  sing:

2.God has many gifts,
Given  by  His  Son-
Building the body of Christ,
Creating  a faith that is one;

3.We  are  the  family  of  God,
Joined  by  the  Spirit above,
Working together with Christ,
Growing and building in love.
