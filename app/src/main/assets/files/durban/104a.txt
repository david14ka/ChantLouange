[PRECIOUS MEMORIES] 

1
Precious memories, unseen angels,
Sent from somewhere to my soul;
How they linger, ever near me,
And the sacred past unfold.
 
[Chorus]
Precious memories, how they linger,
How they ever flood my soul;
In the stillness of the midnight,
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.

2
Precious father, loving mother,
Fly across the lonely years;
And old home scenes of my childhood,
In fond memory appear.

3
In the stillness of the midnight,
Echoes from the past I hear;
Old-time singing, gladness bringing,
From that lovely land somewhere.

4
As I travel on lifeâ€™s pathway,
Know not what the years may hold;
As I ponder, hope grows fonder,
Precious memories flood my soul.
