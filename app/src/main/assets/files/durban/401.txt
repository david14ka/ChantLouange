[KHANGEL’ UMSINDISI WETHU]

1
Khangel’ uMsindisi wethu
Ebethelw’ emthini;
Hayi, uthando olungaka
Ngokufel’ aboni!

Consider our Saviour, nailed on the cross.
His Love is so great that He died for sinners!

[Chorus]
Hayi, iMvana eyophayo 
Yahlatshelwa thina;
Hayi, uMmeli wabonayo
Wasimela thina!

O the Lamb that bled for us; 
The Lamb that was slain for us!

2
Izwa ethi, “Thethelela
Labababulali;
Abakwazi lokhu, Baba,
Abakwenze kimi.”

He said: Forgive these murderers. 
Father, they don’t know what they ‘ve done to me.

3
Wasekhala, “Thixo wami,
Ungishiyeleni?”
Wagebis’ ikhanda lakhe,
Wafa ngenxa yethu.

He cried: Father, why  have You forsaken me? 
Then He bowed His head and died for us.

4
Wasuzamazam’ umhlaba
Ekufeni kwakhe;
Ilanga lafihlakala;
Aqhephuk’ amatshe.

Then the earth shook because of His death.
The sun was hidden; stones  were broken

5
Bhek’ icala lihlawulwe
Ngobuhlungu bakhe;
Nakithina uzwakele
Lowomusa wakhe.

He suffered so much painful work for us 
Let’s consider His Grace
