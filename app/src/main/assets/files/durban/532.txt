[PRECIOUS BLOOD] 

1
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Shed on Calvary;
Shed for rebels, shed for sinners,
Shed for you.
 
[Chorus]
Precious, precious blood of Jesus
Ever flowing free;
Oh believe it; Oh, receive it,
It is for you.

2
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Let it make you whole;
Let it flow in mighty cleansing,
Over your soul.

3
Precious blood that has redeemed us!
All the price is paid;
Perfect pardon now is offered,
Peace is made.

4
Precious blood, by this we conquer
In the fiercest fight,
Sin and Satan overcoming
By its might.
