[LOW IN THE GRAVE HE LAY]

1
Low in the grave He lay,
Jesus, my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day,
Jesus, my Lord!

[Chorus]
Up from the grave He arose!
With a mighty triumph oâ€™er His foes,
He arose a victor from the dark domain,
And He lives forever with the saints to reign,
He arose, He arose,
Halleluiah! Christ arose!

2
Vainly they watch His bed,
Jesus, my Saviour,
Vainly the seal the dead,
Jesus, my Lord.

3
Death cannot keep his prey,
Jesus, my Saviour,
He tore the bars away,
Jesus, my Lord.
