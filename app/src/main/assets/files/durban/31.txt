[MARVELLOUS GRACE]

1
Marvellous grace of our loving Lord, 
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt. 
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured, 
There where the Blood of the Lamb was spilt. 

[Chorus]
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin.

2
Sin and despair like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
Points to the Refuge, the Mighty Cross.

3
Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today. 

4
Marvellous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe;
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?
