[JOYFUL, JOYFUL]  

1
Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
God of glory, Lord of love;
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,
Opâ€™ning to the Sun above,

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
Drive the dark of doubt away;
Giver of eternal gladness,
Fill us with the light of day!

2
All Thy works with joy surround Thee,
Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,
Stars and angels sing around Thee,
Centre of unbroken praise:

Field and forest, vale and mountain,
Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea,
Singing bird and flowing fountain,
Call us to rejoice in Thee.

3
Thou art giving and forgiving,
Ever blessing, ever blest,
Wellspring of the joy of living,
Ocean depth of happy rest!

Thou the Father, Christ our Brother, 
All who live in love are Thine:
Teach us how to love each other,
Lift us to the joy divine.

4
All saints join the mighty chorus,
Which the morning stars began; 
God of love is reigning o'er us,
Brotherly love binds us all.

Ever singing, march we onward,
Victors in the midst of strife;
Joyful music lifts us upward
In the triumph song of life.
