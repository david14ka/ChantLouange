[CHRIST THE LORD IS RISEN!]

1
Christ, the Lord, is risen today;
Raise your joy  and triumph  high.
Alleluia!    Alleluia! 
Alleluia!    Alleluia!

2
Love’s redeeming work is done;
Fought the fight, the battle won.
Alleluia!    Alleluia! 
Alleluia!    Alleluia!

3
Christ has burst the gates of hell;
Death in vain forbids His rise.
Alleluia!    Alleluia! 
Alleluia!    Alleluia!

4
Our Glorious King lives again!
Where, o death, is now your sting?
Alleluia!    Alleluia! 
Alleluia!    Alleluia!

5
Hymns of praise then let us sing;
Unto Christ, our heavenly King.
Alleluia!    Alleluia! 
Alleluia!    Alleluia!

6
Soar we now where Christ has led;
Made like Him, like Him we rise.
Alleluia!    Alleluia! 
Alleluia!    Alleluia!
