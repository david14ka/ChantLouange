[ABIDE WITH ME]
 
1
Abide with me, fast falls the eventide,
The darkness deepens- 
Lord with me abide!
When other helpers fail, and comfort flee,
Help of the helpless, 
Oh, abide with me!

2
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day,
Earth joys grow dim, 
its glory pass away,
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou changest not, 
Abide with me.

3
I need Thy presence every passing hour,
What but Thy grace 
Can foil the tempter’s power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, 
Lord, abide with me!

4
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless,
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness,
Where is death’s sting? 
Where, grave, thy victory?
In triumph still if 
Thou abide with me!

5
Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom 
And point me to the skies,
Heaven’s morning breaks 
And earth’s vain shadows flee,
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me
