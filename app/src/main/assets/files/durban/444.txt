[SAVIOUR, LIKE A SHEPHERD] 

1
Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,
Much we need Thy tender care;
In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Thy folds prepare.

Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us,Thine we are. (X2)

2
 We are Thine, do Thou befriend us,
Be the Guardian of our way;
Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray.

Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us,Thine we are. (X2)

3
Thou hast promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful though we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse, and power to free.

Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us,Thine we are. (X2)

4
Early let us seek Thy favour,
Early let us do Thy will;
Blessed Lord and only Saviour,
With Thy love our bosoms fill.

Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us,Thine we are. (X2)
