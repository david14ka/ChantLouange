[JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOUR]

1
Jesus Christ our Saviour’s
Preparing for us,
The glorious New City 
Of Jerusalem. 

Jesus Christ our Saviour’s
Preparing for us,
The glorious New City 
Of Jerusalem.  

[Chorus]
This world is old with all its mountains,
This world is old,  no longer looking good;

While Jesus our Saviour’s preparing for us,
The glorious new City of Jerusalem.
( repeat ) 

2
All men living in this world
Ought to know the news,
That very soon on the cloud 
The Lord will appear.

All men living in this world 
Ought to know the news,
That very soon on the cloud 
The Lord  will appear.

All the saints will be taken 
Up into the cloud,
The sinners will be cast 
Into burning furnace.

All the saints will be taken 
Up into the cloud,
The sinners will be cast 
Into burning furnace.
