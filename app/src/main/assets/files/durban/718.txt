[THERE IS A REDEEMER] 

1
There is a Redeemer
Jesus, God's own Son

Precious Lamb of God, Messiah
Holy One

[Chorus]
Thank you, oh my Father
For giving us Your Son

And leaving Your Spirit
'Til Your work on Earth is done

2
Jesus my Redeemer
Name above all names

Precious Lamb of God, Messiah
Oh, for sinners slain

3
When I stand in Glory
I will see His Face

There I'll serve my King forever
In that Holy Place
