[THE OLD-TIME RELIGION] 

1
It’s the old-time Holy Spirit,
And the devil won’t go near It,
That the reason people fear It,
But it’s good enough for me.

[Chorus]
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It’s good enough for me!
(repeat)

2                       
It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you’re dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And it’s good enough for me.

3
It’s so good I want no other,
For it makes me love my brother;
And it brings things from under cover,
And it’s good enough for me.

4
It was good in the fiery furnace;
It was good for Paul and Silas; 
It was good for our fathers;
And it’s good enough for me.

5
Makes me love everybody;
It will do when I’m dying;
It will take us all to heaven;
And it’s good enough for me.
