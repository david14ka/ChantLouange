[JESUS, LEAD ME UP]

1
Jesus, lead me up the mountain,
Where the whitest robes are seen,
Where the saints can see the fountain,
Where the pure are keeping clean.

[Chorus]
Lead me higher up the mountain,
Give me fellowship with Thee;
   
In Thy light I see the fountain,
And the blood is cleansing me. (X2)      

2
Higher up, where light increases,
Rich above all earthly good,
Where the life of sinning ceases,
Where the Spirit comes in flood.

3
Lead me higher, nothing dreading,
Never in the race to stop,
In Thy footsteps keep me treading,
Give me grace to reach the top.

4
Save me better, make me surer,
Put me where the fire refines,
Where the breath of hope is purer,
Where the brightest glory shines.
