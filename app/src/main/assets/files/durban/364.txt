[IF THE WORLD FROM YOU]

1
If the world from you withholds 
Of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along 
With meagre fare;

Just remember, in His word, 
How He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

[Chorus]
Leave it there, leave it there,
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there;

If you trust and never doubt,
He will surely bring you out;

Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

2
If your body suffers pain, 
And your health you can’t regain,
And your soul is almost 
Sinking in despair;

Jesus knows the pain you feel, 
He can save and He can heel;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it  there.


3
When your enemies assail 
And your heart begins to fail,
Don’t forget that God in heaven 
Answers prayer;

He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through; 
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.


4
When your youthful days are gone 
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends beneath 
The weight of care,

He will never leave you then, 
He will lead you to the end,
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.
