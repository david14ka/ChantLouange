[TELL IT TO JESUS] 

1
Are you weary, are you heavy hearted?  
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.
Are you grieving over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus  alone.

[Chorus]
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a friend that’s well known.
You’ve no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus  alone.

2
Do the tears flow down your cheeks unbidden? 
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.

Have you sins that to men’s eyes are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

3
Do you fear the gathering clouds of sorrow? 
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.

Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow? 
Tell it to Jesus  alone.

4
Are you troubled at the thought of dying?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.

For Christ’s coming kingdom are you sighing? 
Tell it to Jesus  alone.
