[THE NAME OF JESUS] 

1
The Name of Jesus is so sweet,
I love its music to repeat;

It makes my joy full and complete,
The precious Name of Jesus.
     
[Chorus]
“JESUS” - Oh, how sweet the Name!
“JESUS” - Every day the same;
“JESUS” - Let all saints proclaim,
Its worthy praise forever!

2
I love the Name of Him whose heart,
Knows all my grieves and bears a part;

Who bids all anxious fears depart,
I love the Name of Jesus.

3
That Name I fondly love to hear,
It never fails my heart to cheer;

Its music dries the falling tear,
Exalt the Name of Jesus!

4
No word of man can ever tell,
How sweet the Name I love so well;

Oh!  Let its praises ever swell,
Oh!  Praise the Name of Jesus!
