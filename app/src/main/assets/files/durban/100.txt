[JESUS PAID IT ALL]  

1
I hear the saviour say,
“Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in me thine all in all.

[Chorus]
Jesus paid it all.
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain:
He washed it white as snow

2
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow’r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper’s spots,
And melt the heart of stone.

3
Since nothing good have I 
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I’ll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.
