[ONE DAY] 

1
One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin 
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
Dwelt amongst men, 
My example is He! 
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!

[Chorus]
Living, He loved me; 
Dying,  He saved me;
Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever;
One day He’s coming oh, 
Glorious day!

2
One day they led Him 
Up Calvary’s mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

3
One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden, 
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

4
One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death He has conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

5
One day the trumpet 
Will sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glories will shine;
Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!
