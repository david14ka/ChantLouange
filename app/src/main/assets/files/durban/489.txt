[BE LIKE JESUS]

1.Earthly pleasures vainly call me
I would be like Jesus:
Nothing worldly shall enthral me
I would be like Jesus.

[Chorus]
Be like Jesus, this is my song.
In the home and in the throng:
Be like Jesus all day long!
I would be like Jesus.  

2.He has broken every fetter.
I would be like Jesus:
That my soul may serve Him better,
I would be like Jesus.  

3.All the way from earth to glory,
I would be like Jesus:
Telling over and over the story,
I would be like Jesus.

4.That in heaven He may meet me,
I would be like Jesus:
That His words well done 
May greet me
I would be like Jesus.
