[PRAISE HIM! PRAISE HIM!] 

1
Praise him! Praise him!  
Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Sing, O earth – His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him! Hail Him! Highest archangels in glory;

	Strength and honor, give to his Holy Name!
	Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
	In his arms He carries them all day long.

[Chorus]
Praise him! Praise him!
Tell of his excellence greatness;
Praise Him! Praise Him 
Ever in joyful song!

2
Praise Him! Praise Him!  
Jesus our blessed Redeemer!
For our sins He suffered and bled and died;  
He – our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,

	Hail Him! Hail Him! Jesus the Crucified!
	Sound His praises, Jesus who bore our sorrows,
	Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong.


3       
Praise Him! Praise Him!  
Jesus our blessed Redeemer!
Heavenly portals, loud with hosannas ring!
Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever:

   Crown Him! Crown Him! 
   Prophet, and Priest, and King!
   Christ is coming, over the world victorious,
   Power and glory unto the Lord belong.
