[IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND]

1
With my Saviour ever near to guide me 
I am safe, whatever may betide me
From the storm and tempest He will hide me
In the hollow of His hand.

[Chorus]
In the hollow of His hand
In the hollow of His hand
I am safe, whatever may betide me
In the hollow of His hand
(repeat)

2
In His arms of love He does enfold me,
Words of peace His voice divine hath told me,
I am safe for God himself does hold me,
In the hollow of His hand.

3
He will guard my soul and leave me never,
From His love no power on earth shall sever,
And I know Heâ€™ll keep me now and ever,
In the hollow of His hand.
