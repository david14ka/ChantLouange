[THE SOLID ROCK] 

1
My hope is built on nothing less 
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness; 
I dare not trust the sweetest frame; 
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.
     
[Chorus]
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; 
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

2
When darkness seems to hide His face, 
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

3
His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

4
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
