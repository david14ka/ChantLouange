[BWANA UNIPELEKE]

1
Bwana unipeleke 
kule kwa Baba
Kule muji wa raha 
mlango ni Yesu
Tuta hishi naye 
kule mbinguni

Lord Jesus,  take me yonder to the Father
The door to the City is the Lord Jesus
We shall dwell with the Lord in that Holy City.

[Chorus]
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! 
Oh, Alleluia! (X2)
Mule ndani ya Yesu
Muna raha ya ajabu
Hisiyo na mwisho
Kule mbinguni

O Alleluia!There is such great comfort in the Lord Jesus; 
There is everlasting gladness in the City!

2
Yerusalema mupya, 
mji wa amani
Unametameta,
Unapambwapambwa
Kwa ajili yangu, 
kweli ni ajabu.

The New Jerusalem is an amazing City.
What a sparkling City! O such a bright City!
It is made for my sake. How wonderful!

3
Siku inakuja 
hile ya furaha,
Tuta rugaruga, 
tuta chezacheza
Kwenye barabara 
hile ya zahabu.

The great day of happiness is coming;
We’ll be jumping with joy, praising and dancing
In the heavenly streets, paved with such pure gold!
