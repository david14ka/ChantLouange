[SUCH LOVE] 

1
That God should love 
a sinner such as I,
Should yearn to change 
my sorrow into bliss;

Nor rest till He had planned 
to bring me nigh,
How wonderful 
is love like this!

[Chorus]
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love;

That God should love
A sinner such as I;

How wonderful 
is love like this!

2
That Christ should join 
so freely in the scheme;
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary;

Did ever human tongue 
find nobler theme; 
Than love divine 
that ransomed me?    

3
That for a wilful 
outcast such as I;
The Father planned, 
the Saviour bled an died;

Redemption for a 
worthless slave to buy;
Who long had law 
and grace defied.

4
And now He takes me 
to His heart, a son;
He asks me not 
to fill a servant’s place;

The “far-off country” 
wand’rings all are done;
Wide open are 
His arms of grace.
