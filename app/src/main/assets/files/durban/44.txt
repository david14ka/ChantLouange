[ALL HAIL JESUS’ NAME]

[F]

1.All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

2.Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,
Ye ransomed from the fall;
Hail Him, who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all;
Hail Him, who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all.  

3.Sinners, whose love can ne’er forget
The wormwood and the gall’
Go, spread your trophies at His feet
And crown Him Lord of all;
Go, spread your trophies at His feet
And crown Him Lord of all.

4.Let every kindred, every tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all; 
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.

5.O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall;
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all;
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all.
