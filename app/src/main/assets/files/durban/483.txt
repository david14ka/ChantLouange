[I’D RATHER HAVE JESUS]

1
I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold, 
I’d rather be His than have riches untold;

I’d rather have Jesus than houses or lands
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.


[Chorus]
Jesus Christ loved me before I knew him,
He’s the Good Shepherd and my Redeemer,

I’d rather have Jesus than anything
This world  affords today.


2
I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause,
I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause,

I’d rather have Jesus than worldwide fame;
I’d rather be True to His Holy Name.


3
He’s fairer than the lilies of rarest bloom;
He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb,

He’s all that my hungering  spirit needs;
I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead.
