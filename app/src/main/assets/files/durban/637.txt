[IN TIMES LIKE THESE]

1
In times like these you need a Saviour,
In times like these you need an anchor; 

Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!
 

[Chorus]
This Rock is Jesus, Yes He's the One,
This Rock is Jesus, the only One;

Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!


2
In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these, O be not idle; 

Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!


3
In times like these I have a Saviour,
In times like these I have an anchor;

I'm very sure, I'm very sure
My anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!
